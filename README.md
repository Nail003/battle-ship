# Battle Ship Game

**Battle Ship Game** is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleship game, developed as one of my TOP assignments. This project demonstrates the use of modern JavaScript modules, CSS styling, and Babel for transpilation. It also includes testing support using Jest.

## About

The **Battle Ship Game** project is an interactive implementation of the classic board game where players place ships and attempt to sink each other’s fleet. This assignment challenged me to apply modern JavaScript practices including ES6 modules, and to set up a build environment using Babel. The project’s structure is modular, with separate folders for classes, modules, and CSS assets.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Start a new game, reorder ships, and play against the computer.
- **Modular Code:** The game logic is divided into classes and modules for maintainability.
- **Modern JavaScript:** Utilizes ES6 modules and is configured with Babel for compatibility.
- **Testing:** Testing is configured using Jest to help ensure game functionality.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nail003/battle-ship.git
   cd battle-ship
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Since this is a browser-based game, you can run it by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. For a better development experience, you might consider using a live server.

For example, if you have the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in Visual Studio Code, right-click on `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.

### Game Controls

- **Start Button:** Click the **Start** button to begin a new game.
- **Reorder Ships:** Use the **Reorder Ships** button to change the placement of your ships.
- **Game Messages:** Follow on-screen instructions and messages to complete the game.

## Testing

The project uses Jest for testing. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will start Jest in watch mode and run the available test suites.

## Built With

- **JavaScript (ES6):** For game logic and interactivity.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For layout and styling.
- **Babel:** For transpiling modern JavaScript code.
- **Jest:** For unit testing.
